Title: Syncing reading progress from Kobo to Calibre

----

Text:

While updating this site I wanted to add my reading history into the library section.  To do this required me to find out when I completed reading my books on my Kobo eReader.  This information wasn't available in the UI, but I figured it must be accessible somehow.  

It turns out it is possible to get this information using Calibre and a plugin called Kobo Utilities.  This is not super well documented, and the solution is buried in forum answers, so I thought I'd document it.


## Install the Kobo Utilities plugin


## Add custom columns
There are 4 bits of information you can sync:
* Current read location
* Read percentage
* Rating
* Last read date

To access these you need to set up custom columns in Calibre.

koboreadloc, Text, column shown in tag browser
koboreadpct, Integers
koborating, Ratings, shown with stars, or Integers
kobolastread, Date

## Configure the plugin
Once you've added the columns you want.  Go to the Kobo utilities plugin 'Configure plugin' this will allow you to connect the fields up with a profile.

The plugin has 2 actions for this data: 'store' and 'restore'.  Store pulls the information from your device to the Calibre library, and 'restore' pushes data from Calibre to the Kobo device.

The plugin allows you to configure a couple of options around how you want the syncing to occur.  I selected 'store on connect' and 'only if newer'.
