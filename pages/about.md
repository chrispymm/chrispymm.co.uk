# About Me

**I am a problem solver** 

I've been designing and writing code since my late teens.  I have never specialised in one particular area, but instead have developed broad range of skills across the full spectrum of building for the web; front end, back end, design, typography, sysadmin and devops.  

Since school I have always had a love of design. 

Unlike art, design has a *purpose*, it has constraints, the end has to *work*.  If it doesn't then its not good design.
